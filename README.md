# MERN Stack Book Store Project

This project is a full-stack Book Store application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to perform CRUD operations on books and offers a seamless user experience.

## **Features**
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic
  - MongoDB and Mongoose for database management
  - RESTful APIs for CRUD operations
  - MVC architecture for maintainable codebase
  - CORS policy handling

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js with Vite for fast development
  - React Router DOM for Single Page Application (SPA) navigation
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI
  - Modular components for reusability
  - Book Cards with details, add, edit, and delete functionalities
  - Book Modal for smooth user interaction
  - Beautiful alerts for better UX
